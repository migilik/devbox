Experimental project testing the use of nim as primary language for
both client/server sides of a web application.

For starters, just see if can do a simple to-do list.

If this goes well, stage 2 will be to develop the actual web
application: a remote development environment with an HTML5 front end.

Prerequisites:
install nim and nimble.

To run:
nim js src/client.nim
chrome index.html
